드디어 챕터 3... 책을 하도 안읽다가 기억나서 다시 읽기 시작했다.

* Probability theory is a mathematical framework for representing uncertain statements.
* In AI applications, there are two methods to use prob theory
  * to reason AI systems
  * to analyze the behavior of proposed AI systems.
* need additional resource? -> see [Jaynes (2003)](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Theory-Science-T-Jaynes/dp/0521592712)

## 3.1 Why Probability?

* there are three possible sources of uncertainty
  * **Inherent stochasticity in the system being modeled.**
  * **Incomplete observability.** Even deterministic systems can appear stochastic when they cannot observe all of the variable.
  * **Incomplete modeling.** when we use a model that must discard some of the observed information, the discarded information results in uncertainty.
* In many case, it is more practical to use a simple, uncertainty rule rather than complex, certain one.
